# scdeErrorModelsEx

This is a repository for a webpage ([http://kdkorthauer.github.io/scdeErrorModelsEx/](http://kdkorthauer.github.io/scdeErrorModelsEx/)) that contains a minimal working example to explore sensitivity of SCDE error model fits and down stream analysis to cell grouping assumptions. The .Rmd file that generates the .html file displayed at the webpage is also included.
